        </h2>

        <p class="article">
          National Institute of Technology Raipur (Formerly Government
          Engineering College Raipur), situated in the capital of a newly
          Incepted state of Chhattisgarh, has proven to be "avant-grade' in the
          field of science and technology over past few decades in this region.
          With sweet memory of foundation ceremony by our President Hon'ble Dr.
          Rajendra Prasad on 14th September 1956, the institute started with two
          departments namely Metallurgical and Mining Engineering. Later the
          inauguration of the Institute building was done by our Prime Minister
          Hon'ble Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru on 14th March 1963. From 1st December
          2005, the institute has become the National Institute of Technology.
          The institution has grown in tandem with the major surrounding
          industries â€“ The Bhilai Steel Plant, SECL BALCO and NTPC Korba. It
          currently offers 12 Undergraduate and 6 Postgraduate courses including
          MCA and M.Tech in Applied Geology.

        </h2>

        <hr class="red title-hr" />
        <p class="article">
          ICPC<sup>2</sup>T 2021 is organized by National Institute of
          Technology, Raipur and is co- sponsored technically by IEEE Industry
          Applications Society (IAS), IEEE Bombay Section, IEEE Student Section,
          NIT-Raipur. Theme of the conference is power, control and soft
          computing technologies. Also, the presented papers will be eligible
          for further review to be published in the IEEE Transaction on Industry
          Applications or IEEE IAS Magazine. ICPC<sup>2</sup>T will give a
          chance to the students, academicians, researchers, scientists and
          practicing engineers to have a platform for potential knowledge
          exchange on recent trends, theories and practices in Power which
          includes both renewable and non-renewables sources, their control
          systems and soft skill computational technologies like ML, deep
          learning, AI etc. Particularly, emphasis will be placed on promotion
          of new and renewable power sources, EVs, smart city, smart grid and
          related cyber-physical systems. Applications of data analytics to
          power systems, such as demand response and demand side management will
          be considered. Finally, the innovative use of artificial intelligence,
          machine learning and deep learning and data visualization approaches
          for the power management in a variety of contexts including EVs, smart
          grid, smart city etc. will be of interest. ICPC<sup>2</sup>T may also feature
          invited talks and Keynote addresses from eminent
          professors/scientists from across the world, pre-conference
          workshops/tutorials from active engineers and technical paper
          presentations of the participants from different parts of the world.
