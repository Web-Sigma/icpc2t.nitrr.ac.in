          ICPC2T will give a chance to the students / academicians / researchers
          / scientists /practicing engineers to have a platform for potential
          knowledge exchange on recent trends the theory and practice of Power
          Systems, Control systems and Computational Technologies. Particularly,
          emphasis will be placed on promotion of New and Renewable sources of
          Power, Smart Grid and related cyber-physical systems. This will
          include new methods and procedures for distributed control, as well as
          their application to different levels of the grid, ranging from
          transmission and distribution systems to micro-grids to home energy
          management. Authors may also discuss various issues related to grid
          integration of various conventional and non-conventional resources
          covering distributed generation, grid storage systems and electric
          vehicles. The design of relevant power electronic systems and fault
          protection systems will also be in scope. Efficient data processing
          techniques for all kinds of grid data, including smart meters, phasor
          measurement unit measurements, grid status reports, etc should be
          discussed. Applications of data analytics to power systems, such as
          demand response and demand side management will be considered.
          Finally, the innovative use of artificial intelligence, machine
          learning and deep learning and data visualization approaches for the
          power management in a variety of contexts including efficient network
          management, improved situational awareness and anomaly detection will
          be of interest. ICPC2T features invited talks and Keynote address from
          eminent professors/scientists from across the world, pre-conference
          workshops/tutorials from active engineers and technical paper
          presentation of the participants from different parts of the world.
          All these sessions will cover a wide variety of topics to cater to the
          needs of specific subject areas for our Research Scholars as well as
          Faculty members. With the excellent coverage and potential authors,
          the Proceedings of this conference provide outstanding support to the
          participants in their research works. ICPC2T is very much focused on
          the quality of the papers to be presented in the conference. ICPC2T
          will adopt an excellent system for paper evaluation with
          national/international reviewers from across the world. The possible
          plagiarism/duplication would be checked twice through the plagiarism
          checking software once before the papers are sent for technical review
          and next at the stage of acceptance. Accepted papers will be submitted
          for possible inclusion into IEEE Xplore.
